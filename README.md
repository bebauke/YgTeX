# YgTeX - WYSIWYG TeX Editor

For easy creation of formulas in the browser even without any knowledge of TeX I whant to build a tool which is easy to use, simple and versitile. This will be a more modern, open source alternative to [iMathEQ](http://www.imatheq.com). For development i will have a closer look into [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax), [web-xslt's](https://github.com/davidcarlisle/web-xslt) pmml2tex and MathML. [Here](https://www.tuhh.de/MathJax/test/sample-dynamic.html) is an example for MathJax at work.
